# STA304
Projects here are about analyzing a specific data and telling a story about this data. Specifically, the very first part of the project will be an introduction of the data. The second part will be explanations of what I am going to do using this data as well as how these steps can be achieved. I will use some graphs and tables to display the data. Finally, I will discuss some limitation of using this data. All the projects will be completed using RStudio.
